# TODO

## Webserver

- [x] Include shuffled sequences for motif calling
  - [x] Weight bins for summary, linear weight, squared, and all central weight

- [x] Include expression to call motif associations
- [ ] Generate final model from 10 fold CV
- [ ] Create ATAC model for higher granularity across millions of data points
  - [ ] Create larger bed file with extending to 4kb around the OCR
  - [ ] Count 125 bp resolution within this file



## Paper
- Test individual motifs and motif interactions with model
- Motifs (+-) in random sequences, in promoter sequences, in enhancer sequences
	- test motif distances to TSS
	- test motif distances and orientation to other motifs
