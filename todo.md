# TODO

## Webserver

-[x] Include shuffled sequences for motif calling
-[x] Weight bins for summary, linear weight, squared, and all central weight
- Include expression to call motif associations
- Generate final model from 10 fold CV


## Paper
- Test individual motifs and motif interactions with model
- Motifs (+-) in random sequences, in promoter sequences, in enhancer sequences
	- test motif distances to TSS
	- test motif distances and orientation to other motifs
